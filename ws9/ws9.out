PART A:

A_(1) has shape (10, 10), while b_(1) has shape (10,).
A_(1) is nonsingular (has nonzero determinant). The LSE can be solved.
A_(2) has shape (100, 100), while b_(2) has shape (100,).
A_(2) is nonsingular (has nonzero determinant). The LSE can be solved.
A_(3) has shape (200, 200), while b_(3) has shape (200,).
A_(3) is nonsingular (has nonzero determinant). The LSE can be solved.
A_(4) has shape (1000, 1000), while b_(4) has shape (1000,).
A_(4) is nonsingular (has nonzero determinant). The LSE can be solved.
A_(5) has shape (2000, 2000), while b_(5) has shape (2000,).
A_(5) is nonsingular (has nonzero determinant). The LSE can be solved.

PART B:

Simple LSE:
A =
[[ 2  1 -1]
 [-3 -1  2]
 [-2  1  2]]
b =
[[  8]
 [-11]
 [ -3]]
Solution: x =
[[ 2.]
 [ 3.]
 [-1.]]
